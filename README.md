# OIcode-by-mashduihca
All the code of OI/XCPC.


## Goals:
### Week 1 : 2.1 to 2.7
- Solve Problems A&B in 15 minutes.  nearly(17 minutes)
- Always solve C&D. √
- Have at least a (virtual participation) contest × (only participated 4/7)
- Become an expert in codeforces. × (because only a div2 , i'll become an expert in one or two div2 rounds.)
- Learn all kinds of disjoined set union. √ 
- Learn circle-square tree. ×
- Learn inclusion–exclusion principle.
- Learn Aho–Corasick algorithm.  √
- Learn suffix array & suffix automaton.  √ (but not applications)
- Learn balanced binary tree.  ×
- Solve 50 problems. × (36/50)
* subgoal 1&2 will be checked by codeforces VP.

summary: acceptable. 60 pts maybe.

### Week 2 : 2.8 to 2.14
- Solve 60 problems.
- Become an expert.
- Learn SG functions more.
- Learn suffix automation more.
- ...

- 1.29: null.
- 1.30: Tarjan algorithm (graph theory) , Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
- 1.31: Revocable disjoined union set.
- 2.1: null.
- 2.2: Segment tree divide & conquer , Segment tree optimize making graph.
- 2.3: Aho–Corasick algorithm.
- 2.4: Radix sort , Suffix sort.
- 2.5 null.
